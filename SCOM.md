1. Other facilities, equipment, or resources that must be present



## 3.4		Software organization and overview of operation.
This paragraph shall provide a brief description of the organization and operation of the software from the operator's point of view. The description shall include, as applicable:

1. Logical components of the software, from the operator's point of view, and an overview of the purpose/operation of each component
1. Types of inputs/access that can be made to the software and the software's response to each type
1. The reports and other outputs that are produced by the software, including security and privacy considerations for each
1. Typical run times and factors that affect it
1. Organization of software operation into runs. This description shall use a chart, if applicable, showing how the different operations are interrelated. If sets of runs are grouped by time periods or cycles, each set of integrated operations required on a daily, weekly, etc., basis shall be presented. If runs may be grouped logically by organizational level, the groups of runs that can be performed by each organizational level such as headquarters processing, field activity processing, etc., shall be presented.
1. Any system restrictions, waivers of operational standards, information oriented toward specific support areas (for example, library, small computer and teleprocessing support, interfaces with other systems), or other special aspects of processing
1. General description of the communications functions and processes of the software, including, as applicable, a diagram of the communications network used in the system



## 3.5		Contingencies and alternate states and modes of operation.
 This paragraph shall explain the differences in software operation at times of emergency and in various states and modes of operation, if applicable.

## 3.6		Security and privacy.
This paragraph shall contain an overview of the security and privacy considerations associated with the software. A warning shall be included regarding making unauthorized copies of software or documents, if applicable.

## 3.7		Assistance and problem reporting.
This paragraph shall identify points of contact and procedures to be followed to obtain assistance and report problems encountered in operating the software.

# 4.	Installation and setup.
This paragraph shall describe any procedures that the operator must perform to install the software on the equipment, to configure the software, to delete or overwrite former files or data, and to enter parameters for software operation.

# 5.	Description of runs.
This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to provide a description of the runs to be performed. Safety precautions, marked by WARNING or CAUTION, shall be included where applicable.

## 5.1		Run inventory.
This paragraph shall provide a list of the runs to be performed, identifying the software and the jobs that make up each run. It shall include a brief summary of the purpose of each run and shall relate the list to the run descriptions included in the remainder of this section.

## 5.2		Phasing.
This paragraph shall describe acceptable phasing of the software into a logical series of operations. A run may be phased to permit manual or semiautomatic checking of intermediate results, to provide the user with intermediate results for other purposes, or to permit a logical break if higher priority jobs are submitted. An example of the minimum division for most systems would be edit, file update, and report preparation.

## 5.3		Diagnostic procedures.
This paragraph shall provide the setup and execution procedures for any software diagnostics. Included shall be procedures for validation and trouble shooting. All parameters (both input and output), codes, and range values for diagnostic software shall be explained.
